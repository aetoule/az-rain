                            <p>His passion is to educate people about statistics and saving lives. He would like to let people know that every adoption saves TWO lives; the one that you adopt and the one we can put into a Foster home. His dream is to someday have a place where he can house many abandoned or homeless animals, keeping them safe until a forever home is found for them.</p>
